# Extracting faces from cctv footage using Multi Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks and OpenCV

In crime activities, CCTV footage implies a great role but, in most cases, the CCTV footages are too blurry and not clear enough to identify the criminals. This is why it is much important to detect specific faces from low-resolution CCTV footage, where there can be low light, Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks can be used to extract criminal faces in those situations.

## How to run this project

### Steps:

1. Intall OpenCV. For intalling OpenCV, use ```bash pip install opencv-python```
2. Install MTCNN. For installing MTCNN, use ```bash pip install mtcnn```
3. Replace the "video.mp4" file with your desired video. Keep the video file name just as it is.
4. Now run the python script "video.py".
5. It will pop up a processing named window for capturing the faces.
6. The faces will be saved as JPG files in the folder named "Extracted Faces".
